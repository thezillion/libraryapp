# Library App
A Library app that lists books and authors. Runs on Node, implements a GraphQL API Server, and uses a PostgresSQL database.

The project has been Dockerized for ease of use and compatibility.

## Prerequisites
* Docker and docker-compose
* Node package manager

## Run
Clone the repository and run the `init.sh` file. Visit `http://localhost:4000`. The init script basically builds the client code, copies it to the server and runs the docker-compose script to boot it up.
